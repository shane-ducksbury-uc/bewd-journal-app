## To Do

### Main Page
- Routing
- Buttons to get to different sections on Mobile?
- On Desktop - Row for journal entries, Row for Viewing Entry (almost like outlook)

### Journal Entry Page
- Box to enter journal entry
- Title
- Save Button
- Cancel
- Autosaving (extra feature)

### Journal Viewing Page
- Scrollable page on desktop - Calendar on Mobile
- Click to view
- Can delete
- Can open to edit? (should this be a feature? Maybe the idea should be to keep it the same)

### Overall Journal
- Ability to add new journals

### Login Page

### Authentication
- OAuth??
- JWT or OAUTH
- BCRYPT for the password hashing / salting

### REST API
- Create a REST API (In Progress)
- Determine what requests will need to be set up (Basically Done)
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/942951/rest-api-error-return-good-practices
- Install Driver for PostgreSQL (Done)
- Make Express send back errors? (Not Done - Should probably do something about this.)

### Postgres
- Work out DB Table Structure (Probably Users and Journal Entries Connected via ID of User)
